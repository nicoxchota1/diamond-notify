## Installation

- Be sure to download the [latest release](github.com/nicoxchota1/diamond-notify) of the resource, it's always good to stay up to date.
- Place it somewhere inside the `resources` directory
- Add the resource to your `server.cfg` after dependencies to make sure it's started correctly at server startup:
```
ensure diamond_notify
```
